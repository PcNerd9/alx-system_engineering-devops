# 0x13. Firewall

## Description
This project covers the fundamental concepts of firewalls and their role in network security. It explores how to configure firewalls to protect servers and networks from unauthorized access and various types of attacks.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand the purpose and functionality of firewalls.
- Configure basic firewall rules using iptables.
- Identify common types of network threats and how firewalls can mitigate them.

## File Descriptions
- **0-block_all_incoming_traffic_but**: A script that sets up a basic firewall configuration to block all incoming traffic except for specific ports.
- **100-port_forwarding**: A script that demonstrates how to configure port forwarding for a specific service.

## Usage
- Execute the `0-block_all_incoming_traffic_but` script to set up your firewall rules.
- Use the `100-port_forwarding` script to enable port forwarding as needed for your applications.
