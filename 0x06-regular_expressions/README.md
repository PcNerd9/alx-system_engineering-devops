# 0x06. Regular Expressions

## Description
This project introduces the concept of **regular expressions (regex)**, a powerful tool used for matching and manipulating text patterns. In this project, you will explore different regular expression tokens and how to create efficient patterns to match specific text. The focus is primarily on using **Ruby** for implementing regular expressions.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts:
- What a regular expression is
- How to use regular expressions for text pattern matching
- Different regular expression tokens and their meanings
- How to write a regular expression to match a given requirement
- How to apply regular expressions in Ruby scripts

## File Descriptions
- **0-simply_match_school.rb**: A Ruby script that matches the word "School" in a given text.
  
- **1-repetition_token_0.rb**: A Ruby script that uses a regular expression to match a pattern with repetition: `hbn`, `hbtn`, `hbttn`, `hbtttn` and so on.
  
- **2-repetition_token_1.rb**: A Ruby script that matches the pattern `htn` or `hbtn` with one or zero occurrences of `b`.
  
- **3-repetition_token_2.rb**: A Ruby script that matches the pattern `hbtn` with one or more occurrences of `t`.
  
- **4-repetition_token_3.rb**: A Ruby script that matches the pattern `hbtn` with exactly 2 occurrences of `t`.
  
- **5-beginning_and_end.rb**: A Ruby script that matches a string that starts with `h` and ends with `n` and can have any single character in between.
  
- **6-phone_number.rb**: A Ruby script that matches a 10-digit phone number format (without spaces or hyphens).
  
- **7-OMG_WHY_ARE_YOU_SHOUTING.rb**: A Ruby script that matches only capital letters.

## Usage
To run any of the Ruby scripts with a regular expression:
```bash
./<script_name> <text_input>
