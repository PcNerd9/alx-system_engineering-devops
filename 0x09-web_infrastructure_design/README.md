# 0x09. Web Infrastructure Design

## Description
This project focuses on the fundamental concepts of web infrastructure design, which involves creating a robust and scalable architecture for web applications. It covers the components that make up a web stack and how they interact with each other.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand the basic components of web infrastructure.
- Design a simple web stack.
- Recognize the importance of each component in delivering a seamless user experience.

## File Descriptions
- **0-simple_web_stack**: A diagram illustrating a simple web stack architecture, showing how the client interacts with the web server, application server, and database.
- **1-distributed_web_infrastructure**: A diagram that demonstrates a more complex web infrastructure involving load balancers, multiple servers, and redundancy to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

## Usage
- To view the diagrams, open the respective files using an image viewer or a web browser. 
- Analyze the architecture and understand the roles of each component.
