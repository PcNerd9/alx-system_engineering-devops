# 0x16. API Advanced

## Description
This project explores advanced concepts in API interaction, focusing on data retrieval, pagination, and recursion in APIs. It aims to provide a deeper understanding of how to work with complex data structures and implement advanced functionalities in API consumption.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand and implement pagination when working with APIs.
- Utilize recursion to navigate nested data structures.
- Work with external APIs to retrieve and process data efficiently.

## File Descriptions
- **0-subs.py**: A Python script that retrieves subscriber counts from a given subreddit using the Reddit API.
- **1-top_ten.py**: A script that fetches the top ten posts from a specified subreddit.
- **2-recurse.py**: A script that retrieves all hot posts from a subreddit, handling pagination through recursion.
- **main.py**: A testing script that runs and verifies the functionality of the other scripts.
- **test.py**: Contains unit tests for the functions defined in the other scripts.

## Usage
- To retrieve subscriber counts, run `0-subs.py` with the subreddit name as an argument.
- For fetching the top ten posts, execute `1-top_ten.py` with the subreddit name as an argument.
- To retrieve all hot posts recursively, run `2-recurse.py` with the subreddit name.
