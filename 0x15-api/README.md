# 0x15. API

## Description
This project focuses on the basics of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), particularly in the context of interacting with web services. It explores how to gather data from APIs and export that data into different formats.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand the principles of RESTful APIs.
- Use Python to make requests to APIs.
- Process API responses and convert data into CSV and JSON formats.

## File Descriptions
- **0-gather_data_from_an_API.py**: A Python script that fetches data from a public API and processes the response.
- **1-export_to_CSV.py**: A script that takes the data gathered from the API and exports it to a CSV file.
- **2-export_to_JSON.py**: A script that converts the API data into a JSON format.
- **2.csv**: The output CSV file generated by the `1-export_to_CSV.py` script.
- **2.json**: The output JSON file generated by the `2-export_to_JSON.py` script.
- **3-dictionary_of_list_of_dictionaries.py**: A script that structures the API data into a list of dictionaries.

## Usage
- Run `0-gather_data_from_an_API.py` to collect data from the specified API.
- Use `1-export_to_CSV.py` to convert the gathered data to a CSV format.
- Use `2-export_to_JSON.py` to convert the gathered data to JSON format.
