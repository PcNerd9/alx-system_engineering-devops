## Description
This project focuses on debugging web stack issues in a server environment. It involves identifying and resolving common problems that can arise in web applications and ensuring they function correctly.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand how to debug web stack issues.
- Identify common problems in web server configurations.
- Apply fixes to ensure that web applications run smoothly.

## File Descriptions
- **0-iamsomeoneelse**: A script that modifies the user's identity on a web server to troubleshoot permission issues.
