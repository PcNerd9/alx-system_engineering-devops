# 0x07. Networking Basics #0

## Description
This project covers the basic concepts of **computer networking**, including network types, the OSI model, MAC addresses, IP addresses, TCP, UDP, and ports. It is designed to introduce fundamental networking concepts to help understand how devices communicate over networks.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts:
- What an OSI model is and its importance
- The different types of computer networks (LAN, WAN, etc.)
- The role of MAC addresses and IP addresses in networking
- The differences between TCP and UDP protocols
- How ports facilitate communication between devices
- The basic flow of data across a network

## File Descriptions
- **0-OSI_model**: A text file that answers questions about the OSI model, including what the OSI model is, its layers, and the importance of each layer.
  
- **1-types_of_network**: A text file that answers questions about the different types of computer networks, including LAN, WAN, and the differences between them.
  
- **2-MAC_and_IP_address**: A text file that explains what MAC addresses and IP addresses are, their roles in network communication, and how they differ.
  
- **3-UDP_and_TCP**: A text file that explains the key differences between TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
  
- **4-TCP_and_UDP_ports**: A text file that describes the function of ports in networking and the difference between well-known and dynamic ports.
  
- **5-is_the_host_on_the_network**: A Bash script that uses `ping` to check if a remote host (IP address) is on the network.

## Usage
- To view the contents of each file, simply open the corresponding file using a text editor of your choice:
```bash
cat <file_name>
